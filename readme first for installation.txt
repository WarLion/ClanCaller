the first step is to change your database information here on the file located on the folder
_database/database.php
and change your clan name on the same file

    $hostname = "localhost";
    $user = "username";
    $password = "password";
    $database = "database name";
    $prefix = "";
    
  
    
    
    import the sql files located on the folder to phpmyadmin
    _database/database.sql
    
    dont forget to delete the sql file after you add it to your database 
    
    login to the site using
